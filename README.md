Repository Guidelines (Rules)  
|-Commit Rules  
| |-Commit Message Rules  
| | |-Use complete sentences, terminated by a period.  
| | |-Do not use abbreviations unless absolutely necessary, and when used, they must be all upper case like HTML.  
| | |-No profanity, immaturity, or extreme failure to spell will be tolerated (strict).  
| | |-Must be fully descriptive of all edits made (or problem in the case of an issue).  
| | |-Must not be under 3 words or over 10 words (only for title in the case of an issue).  
| | |-These rules loosely apply to merge explanations and issues.  
| | |-EXCEPTION: Usage of the default commit messages are allowed. 
| | |-If these rules are not met, infringing material may be deleted, removed, or changed.
| |-Commit Frequency Rules  
| | |-Do not commit more than twice in any five minute period.  
| |-Commit Checklist  
| | |-Before making any changes to the repository, "Sync" (GUI) or "git pull" (CMD) to update your copy. Otherwise a merge will be necessary, and may pose a danger to data integrity.  
| | |-Use N/A (GUI) or "git add *" (CMD).  
| | |-Write a thoughtful commit message, spending atleast 10 seconds to properly articulate and spell check it.  
| | |-Use "Commit" (GUI) or "git commit" + "git push" (CMD).  
|-Forking Rules  
| |-Do not under any circumstances "Fork" (GUI) the repository.  
| |-If you do, delete the fork if possible to reduce clutter.  
|-Branching Rules  
| |-Do not under any circumstances create a branch, especially one tagged as a 'master' branch.  
|-General Usage Guidelines  
| |-If you are unsure about how to proceed with any issue you notice, simply create an issue.  
| |-Do not try to damage the repository.  
| |-Use common sense.  
| |-Ask if you are unsure about how to use GitHub.
