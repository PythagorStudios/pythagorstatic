									<h3 class="major">What's RIVERSIDE?</h3>
									<p>Hola, it’s Jinho, Game Designer for APEX and Starfish, again. RIVERSIDE was the original idea of Finn Bear, our lead programmer. Technically, he should be writing this blog post, but he’s away doing important programming work like feeding Trader Joe’s organic hazelnuts to squirrels. So here I am. (In all honestly, I can't complain. He's been doing loads of work.)</p>

									<p>RIVERSIDE takes place in a wonderful little paradise called Riverside High School, where two hundred students compete to fight their way to the top or bottom of a ranking system based on good or bad behavior. Getting to either of these ends of the spectrum within the time limit of the game gets you a win. Alternatively, you can win by being expelled, as local law makes nearly illegal to expel a student, however. </p>

									<p>Now, you might expect there to be a bit of a dichotomy regarding how enjoyable the game would be depending on what goal you’re aiming for. Grand Theft Auto began as a game where you could play as either a cop or a criminal, but only the criminal part was kept since it was the only part people actually played. But the same won’t happen in RIVERSIDE. That’s because we’ve planned for there to be certain actions a player can take when going down the “good” path- actions to sabotage the efforts of other players attempting the same, which we hope will balance the paths a player can take. </p>
									
									<p>We foresee that RIVERSIDE might work well as a mobile game- any number of players could be matched up randomly and play with each other over the course of a month or week. Alternatively, the game could also be an online computer game like APEX and Starfish and have singleplayer be its main feature. There’s no reason it couldn’t be both, though. </p>
									
									<p>In conclusion, however, I’d like to remind everyone that RIVERSIDE is still an extremely early concept at this point. Therefore, everything I’ve written above could be completely false in a year’s time. When coding actually begins on it. I might be rereading this, shaking my head and laughing. </p>
									
									<p>That’s all for the first Future blog entry. Adios. </p>
