									<h3 class="major">Starfish: Our Vision</h3>
									<p>     Hey everyone, I’m Jinho, Game Designer for APEX and Starfish, and the original creator of Starfish’s concept. Now, some of you might be wondering why we decided to call this game Starfish. In fact, we used a random name generator.</p>
									<p>     No, we didn’t. The word “starfish” refers to the term “starfish alien,” meaning an alien that’s morphologically or psychologically extremely different from a human. And that’s one of the guiding themes the team and I are going with in the development of Starfish. Lots of you who are interested in this game are probably also fans of science fiction, a genre in which humanoid aliens, with human thoughts and human governments and human brains are plentiful to the extreme. The alien “archetypes” to be featured in Starfish aren’t going to be like that. We’re going to take great care in the scripting of this game to make sure that each alien civilization you interact with is fresh and one you might not have ever thought about.</p>
									<p>     But the aliens- no matter how fantastical they get- are still going to be hard sci-fi, and be based on real principles, even when we have to speculate. And part of that is the second guiding theme the team and I are going with: the player shouldn’t take anything for granted. That means that your civilization probably won’t start with certain staples of the sci-fi genre. You’ll most probably be restricted to Slower-than-Light Travel and be unable to transmit messages faster than light, and there’ll be systems in place to make sure the gameplay is still engaging.But I say you probably won’t have those techs because, by making certain choices in the civilization creation screen at a cost, you can choose to start with them. But where’s the fun in that?</p>
									<p>     Development of Starfish, as far as actual coding is concerned, is set to begin once APEX really gets on its feet. You can still expect to hear updates about new game concepts and the inner workings of the game, though. Happy Friday, or whatever day it happens to be.</p>
