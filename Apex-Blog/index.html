									<h3 class="major">Started work on the game!</h3>
									<p>Hi everyone! I’m Sanjit, the Team Leader of Pythagor Studios, and I’m excited to announce that Pythagor Studios has begun work on its first game: Gods of APEX! When I came up with the idea to create this game, the first thing I thought about was what the planet it took place on should be named. I wanted a powerful name, and one with meaning. So the team named it APEX, because we want this planet (and this game) to be the best it can possibly be. The name of the game follows naturally from this: Gods of APEX (GoA). </p>

									<p>The team began work on this game a week ago, and I am proud to report that no compromises have been made in the game quality. We used the latest family of graphics, low-poly, when we were designing this game, which also turbo-boosted render times by reducing the number of polygons your computer would have to render. We made sure that it would render as fast as possible using the latest scripting methods in JavaScript. We also decided to allow this game to be played in the browser, to make sure that you, our valued consumer, would not be bothered by any pesky downloads. </p>

									<h3 class="major">Vitae phasellus</h3>
									<p>We came up with a lot of mechanics, after hours and hours of argument. One major argument was over whether we should make this game turn-based or real-time. We ended up agreeing on a compromise, where major decisions, law-editing, and edict-creation are turn-based. However, there will be a cutscene in the middle, where events can occur, and you can be implored to make a decision by your believers. We believe that this will allow slow and fast players to play at a reasonable rate, while still moving the game along quickly. </p>
