									<h3 class="major">Started work on the game!</h3>
									<p>Hi everyone! I’m Sanjit, the Team Leader of Pythagor Studios, and I’m excited to announce that Pythagor Studios has begun work on its first game: Gods of APEX! When I came up with the idea to create this game, the first thing I thought about was what the planet it took place on should be named. I wanted a powerful name, and one with meaning. So the team named it APEX, because we want this planet (and this game) to be the best it can possibly be. The name of the game follows naturally from this: Gods of APEX (GoA). </p>

									<p>The team began work on this game a week ago, and I am proud to report that no compromises have been made in the game quality. We used the latest family of graphics, low-poly, when we were designing this game, which also turbo-boosted render times by reducing the number of polygons your computer would have to render. We made sure that it would render as fast as possible using the latest scripting methods in JavaScript. We also decided to allow this game to be played in the browser, to make sure that you, our valued consumer, would not be bothered by any pesky downloads. </p>

									<p>We came up with a lot of mechanics, after hours and hours of argument. One major argument was over whether we should make this game turn-based or real-time. We ended up agreeing on a compromise, where major decisions, law-editing, and edict-creation are turn-based. However, there will be a cutscene in the middle, where events can occur, and you can be implored to make a decision by your believers. We believe that this will allow slow and fast players to play at a reasonable rate, while still moving the game along quickly. </p>
									<h3 class="major">The Game Engine</h3>
									<p>Bonjour, everyone. This is Jinho Kwak here on behalf of Finn Bear, Lead Developer for Pythagor Studios and the creator of the brilliantly named Pythagor Studios Game Engine we’re creating. The Game Engine is going to be used in all of our upcoming games, which you can read about on other parts of the website, if you haven’t already. The new game engine will allow us to develop content as swiftly as possible. Now, what is it about this game engine that makes it so? Other than, of course, its splendid name. Let’s get right into it. </p>
									<p>The Pythagor Studios Game Engine is coded asynchronously, and so it’s able to cut down on loading times before and during the game. Additionally, this means that performance will be excellent on newer browsers especially. For instance, the game engine regulates the timing of the game-loop, which makes sure the game runs at 30 frames per second constantly, or maybe 60, if we can get it up to that point. In fact, this feature works with older browsers as well as newer ones due to a clever bit of code Finn wrote that’s known as a fallback. </p>
									<p>A fallback is a piece of code that runs only if certain substandard conditions are met, an aforementioned outdated browser being one possible trigger. The game engine uses other fallbacks to ensure that the demanding 3-D graphics of APEX, Starfish, and future titles won’t be a problem for any player, with the 3-D graphics themselves being taken care of by Three.js, a well-known JavaScript framework for three-dimensional rendering. </p>
									<p>If you have any further questions about the Pythagor Studios Game Engine or any of our games at all, feel free to contact us at contact@pythagorstudios.com. Au revoir, and see you on the next blog entry. </p>
									<h3 class="major">What are Cycles?</h3>
									<p>Hallo, everyone, it’s Jinho, Game Designer for APEX and Starfish back for another blog post. Today, we’ll be looking at a basic concept in both of these games that might interest you. This concept is something called a “Cycle.” </p>
									<p>Now, APEX is a turn-based game. For anyone who doesn’t happen to already know, turn-based games function as most board games do—one player makes all of his decisions at once, effects resulting from said decisions occur, then the next player makes his or her decisions, and so on, until the next turn begins and this cycle repeats. </p>
									<p>No, no. It’s a cycle, not the Cycle. I’m getting to that, don’t worry. </p>
									<p>Many grand strategy games like APEX show political change as a part of their gameplay. Periods of harmony that devolve into crises between the player and the AI, which in turn fizzle out and allow lost strength to be rebuilt. The idea of Cycles is to represent this natural progression of how humans think as a hard gameplay mechanic. That might sound like an awful idea, but let me explain. </p>
									<p>As you may have somewhat gathered, there are four Phases to each Cycle: Harmony, Dissent, Crisis, and Reconstruction, in that order. Each Cycle takes one hundred turns, but those turns aren’t spread equally across the four Phases. Harmony and Crisis each take thirty turns, while Dissent and Reconstruction each take only twenty. </p>
									<p>Each Phase also has a number of effects: Harmony makes it less likely for rebellions to arise and accelerates things like research and industry, but it’s more difficult to justify a war. Dissent, as its name suggests, increases divergence and makes religions more likely to split off—two more processes that’ll be explained in a later blog post. Crisis is, well, a crisis. Disagreeing nations are easily able to go to war, and the effectiveness of militaries is increased. Reconstruction following this is exactly the opposite of Dissent, causing religions to slowly drift toward the most powerful, and gives a set of bonuses that help recover from Crisis. </p>
									<p>“Well, okay then, but shouldn’t there be a way to affect the Cycles?” you ask. </p>
									<p>Yes, there should be. There’re a variety of ways to lengthen or shorten a Phase relative to the others. One thing I haven’t mentioned yet is that the effects the Phases give peak at their very middles, and gradually decrease the farther from the middles they get. So by shortening or lengthening Phases, you’re also causing those peaks to move around. </p>
									<p>So, that’s all about Cycles. The other concepts mentioned here will be explained in future posts, as this post is long as it is. Other than that, email us about what you want to know about the game at contact@pythagorsudios.com? Because I’m sure there’re vast hordes of people in line, waiting to view our magnificent website. </p>
									<p>Tschuess, and see you later. </p>
